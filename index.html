                        I am a former Librarian interested in web development. I have fourteen years of library
                        experience, with six of those years working for Jefferson County Library as a Librarian I in
                        Information Services/Cataloging. As a Librarian I in Information Services/Cataloging at
                        Jefferson County Library I assisted patrons and demonstrated the use of reference resources at
                        the information desk, helped patrons with item requests, and helped patrons with the public
                        computers as well as with their own tech devices. My other tasks include cataloging, collection
                        development, and library programming.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        My previous employment was for nearly two years as a Library Assistant in Cataloging at Whitman
                        College. My main task there was providing original and copy cataloging of books, DVDs, and
                        electronic resources. Another responsibility I had was supervising student workers which
                        included monitoring their work, approving schedules, checking timesheets, and training them to
                        catalog government documents.

                        My first library job was for six years as a Library Assistant at the Whitman County Library. My
                        main duties as a Library Assistant were helping library patrons at the reference and circulation
                        desk, coordinating a home library delivery service at two senior living facilities, purchasing
                        and managing the collection for popular movies, music, and eBooks. Also, I was teaching public
                        programs about eBooks, social media, and internet safety, assisting with interlibrary loan, and
                        cataloging movies, music, and large-print books.
